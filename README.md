## About

I am a faithful enthusiast of saving time, that's why I have created this skeleton that brings together Inertia.js, Laravel and Vue in one place.

In principle, it only brings with it the necessary settings to work with these tools.

I share it with the community hoping that it can also serve them, saving a few minutes of configuration.
